# PersistentFogAdjuster

Locks the specified fog value.

This mod was made since fog values set in Ultimate Eyecandy change after several seconds.

With this mod, the fog value set in the mod settings updates every frame, keeping it from deviating.

This is helpful for cinematics and first person views especially with night shots and workflows using cubemaps.

The default locked fog value is -0.49, but can be changed in the mod settings.
